# Exception Handling in Python: Avoiding Index Errors

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that handles an **IndexError** when trying to access an element beyond the available range of a list.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Define a list `a` with some integer elements.
2. Use a **try-except** block:
   - In the `try` block, attempt to access an index that is out of range (e.g., `list1[6]`).
   - In the `except` block, catch the error and print a custom message `"6 is not accepted"`.
3. Print the result based on whether the index access succeeds or fails.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
try:
    n=int(input())
    a = []
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        n1=int(input())
        a.append(n1)
    print(a)
    print(a[6])
                
                
except IndexError:
        print("6 is not accepted")

## Result
Thus, To write a Python program that handles an **IndexError** when trying to access an element beyond the available range of a list is verified.
