# Classes and Objects in Python: Calculate the Area of a Circle

## 🎯 Aim
To write a Python program that calculates the **area of a circle** based on the radius provided by the user. This program uses a class named `cse` and a method `mech` to perform the calculation.

## 🧠 Algorithm
1. **Get user input**: Take the radius of the circle as input from the user.
2. **Define the class**: Create a class named `cse`.
3. **Define the method**: Inside the class, define the method `mech` to calculate the area of the circle using the formula:  
   Area = pi *r^2 
4. **Execute the program**: Create an object of the class and call the method with the radius value.

## 🧾 Program
import math

class cse():

def __init__(self,radius):

    self.radius=radius

def mech(self):

    return math.pi*(self.radius**2)

r=int(input())

obj=cse(r)

print("Area of circle:",round(obj.mech(),2))

## Result
Thus, To write a Python program that calculates the area of a circle based on the radius provided by the user is verified. This program uses a class named cse and a method mech to perform the calculation.
